## Neuroglancer states

Each file here specifies a neuroglancer state which allows you to interact with BANC neurons in some way. To open one of these states, go to the url `https://ng.banc.community/{filename}` where you replace `{filename}` with the name of one of the files in this folder, without `.json`. For example:

- For viewing published neurons: https://ng.banc.community/view
- For BANC community members to proofread cells (merging and splitting incorrectly attached parts of neurons): https://ng.banc.community/edit
- View an example synapse: https://ng.banc.community/2025a/example-synapse
- etc for any other file in this folder or subfolder

If the BANC link shorter isn't responding, try the full URLs instead:

- https://spelunker.cave-explorer.org/#!https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jasper-tms/the-BANC-fly-connectome/main/neuroglancer_states/edit.json
- etc
